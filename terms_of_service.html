</p>
<p>
        ALL PURCHASES AND PAYMENTS OF ALL KINDS IN THE SERVICES ARE STRICTLY VOLUNTARY AND NON-BINDING.
</h2>

<p>
        The Services may include an opportunity to collect through gameplay or to purchase (the "Virtual Items"): (a) virtual in-game "currency", including but not limited to virtual "coins", "points", "credits", "bonuses", "chips"; (b) virtual in-game items, including but not limited to virtual "gems", "chests", "bracelets", "spins", "cards"; (c) certain in-game benefits, including but not limited to additional levels or extra content, all for use in the Services. Virtual Items constitute a specific functionality of gameplay, without any material value, that can be used by you personally only within the Services. Virtual Items have no monetary or material value and cannot be used to purchase or use products or services other than within the applicable Service. Virtual Items cannot be refunded or exchanged for cash or any other tangible value. Virtual Items may not be purchased or sold outside of the Services from any individual or other company via cash, barter or any other transaction. Some number of free Virtual Items may be made available to you to collect when you log into the Service at certain time intervals. Virtual Items purchased or available to you in the Services can only be used in connection with the Services where you obtained them or where they were collected by you as a result of gameplay.
</p>
<p>
        Virtual Items are licensed to you by Thidiem and such license means limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable, revocable license (permit) to use such functionality (those Virtual Items) within the applicable Service, subject to the limitations and other terms set out by Thidiem, and does not transfer ownership of those Virtual Items to you. This license is personal to you and cannot be sold, transferred, assigned, gifted, traded or sublicensed. Other than a limited, personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable, revocable license to use the Virtual Items with the Services, you have no right or title in or to any such Virtual Items appearing or originating with the Services, or any other attributes associated with use of the Services or stored within the Services. Thidiem expressly prohibits and does not recognize any sales, transfers, assignments, gifts, trades, or sublicenses of Virtual Items, whether for money, goods, or any other exchange for anything of value outside of the Services. Any such transfer or attempted transfer is prohibited and void, and may subject you to a termination of your account, a lifetime ban from using Thidiem's products and services, and even legal action.
</p>
<p>
        Thidiem retains the right to manage, control, modify and/or discontinue Virtual Items without notice at its sole discretion, and Thidiem shall have no liability to you or anyone for the exercise of such rights. Prices, availability, % of discount/increase of Virtual Items are subject to change without notice. Thidiem may remove or cancel Virtual Items associated with your account upon its sole discretion.
</p>
<p>
        There is never any requirement to make any purchase of any kind to use the Services. If you wish to purchase Virtual Items, you will be required to pay a fee using "real world" money to obtain Virtual Items. Virtual Items may only be purchased or acquired through means we provide on the applicable Site or otherwise expressly authorize.
</p>
<p>
        Virtual Items purchased in Thidiem's games on applications stores or platforms such as but not limited to Facebook, App Store, or Google Play will be subject to those platforms' payment terms and conditions. Thidiem does not control how you can pay on those platforms and shall not be liable for processing the payment by such third parties. Please review those platforms' terms of service for additional information.
</p>
<p>
        When purchasing Virtual Items or other content as may be made available, you agree to pay the applicable charges for your purchase, including applicable taxes, using a valid charge card or other payment method we may accept in accordance with the terms and prices in effect at the time the fee or charge becomes payable. You agree that you will pay for all Virtual Items you purchase through the Services, and that Thidiem may charge your payment method for any Virtual Items purchased and for any additional amounts (including any taxes and late fees, as applicable) that may be accrued by or in connection with your Account. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TIMELY PAYMENT OF ALL FEES AND FOR PROVIDING US WITH A VALID PAYMENT METHOD FOR PAYMENT OF ALL FEES. When you play Thidiem's games or access any of our other Services on our website infinityslots.com, we are using third-party payment processor for processing payments. For more details please visit: https://www.safecharge.com . Thidiem may change such third-party payment processor in its sole discretion at any time. If such third-party payment processor is modified, Thidiem will update this provision when applicable. Your total price will include the price of Virtual Items plus any applicable tax.
</p>
<p>
        Your purchase of Virtual Items and/or other content is final and is not refundable, transferable or exchangeable, except in Thidiem's sole discretion. You acknowledge that Thidiem is not required to provide a refund for any reason, and that you will not receive money or other compensation for unused Virtual Items when an account is closed, whether such closure was voluntary or involuntary, or whether you made a payment through infinityslots.com or another platform such as Facebook, App Store, or Google Play or any other sites or platforms where we offer our Services. If your account is charged for items or services you did not purchase, charged with any incorrect amount that does not correspond to the number of purchased items and services, or you did not receive any of the ordered additional features, you may request a refund or correction in accordance to payment provider policy. Thidiem shall not be liable for any chargeback and refund claims in the event of an unlawful request, abuse of our Services, or infringement of Thidiem's Terms.
</p>
<p>
